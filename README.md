# Bank Loan Analysis Project

## Project Overview
The **Bank Loan Analysis** project is a Python-based data analysis project aimed at understanding the factors influencing loan approvals and providing actionable insights for banking decision-making. The project performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and interactive visualizations to extract meaningful patterns from loan datasets.

**Dataset:** The dataset is sourced from kaggel and contains information about loan applicants, including personal details, income, credit history, loan amount, and approval status.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Collection
- Dataset downloaded from **Kaggle** containing loan applicant information.  
- Imported into Python using pandas for further analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and duplicates  
- Converted categorical variables to numerical values where required  
- Normalized data for consistency  
- Checked for outliers and corrected inconsistencies

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed distributions of loan approvals and rejections  
- Studied correlations between features such as income, credit score, and loan amount  
- Created visualizations including histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps  

### 4. Data Visualization
- Built interactive dashboards using **Plotly Express**  
- Visualized loan trends across demographics, income groups, and education levels  
- Highlighted key factors affecting loan approval decisions

### 5. Insights & Recommendations
- Identified key factors impacting loan approval (e.g., income, credit history, employment stability)  
- Suggested strategies for risk mitigation and improved loan approval processes  
- Provided actionable recommendations for banking strategy
