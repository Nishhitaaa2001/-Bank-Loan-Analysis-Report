# Bank Loan Analysis Report

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a bank loan dataset using Python, data visualization libraries, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and insights related to loan approvals, customer demographics, and financial behavior to support data-driven decision-making.

---

## Libraries Used
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as px
import warnings
pandas & numpy: Data manipulation and numerical analysis

matplotlib & seaborn: Static data visualization

plotly.express: Interactive visualizations

warnings: Handle and suppress runtime warnings

Dataset
Contains information about loan applicants: personal details, loan amount, income, and loan approval status.

Data preprocessing and cleaning were performed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data entries.

Key Steps in Analysis
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values and duplicates

Converted categorical variables to numerical format where necessary

Normalized data for consistent analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed the distribution of loan approvals and rejections

Studied correlations between applicant features (income, credit score, loan amount)

Visualized trends using histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps

Data Visualization

Created interactive dashboards using Plotly

Generated insights on loan trends across demographics and customer segments

Insights

Identified key factors affecting loan approval

Highlighted potential areas for risk mitigation

Provided actionable recommendations for the bank's decision-making process

Sample Visualizations
Loan approval distribution by gender, income, and education

Correlation heatmap of financial features

Interactive bar and scatter plots for trend analysis
